# Perfume Store

This is a simple e-commerce application designed for selling perfumes. The purpose of this project is purely educational. It was created to practice and apply the concepts I have learned while exploring software development.  

## About the Project

- **Unpolished and Incomplete**: Please note that this application is not production-ready. It is not fully functional and lacks proper organization.  
- **Learning-Oriented**: The project serves as a hands-on experiment to implement various ideas and techniques.  

## Features

The application includes basic functionalities such as:  
- A homepage displaying available perfumes.  
- A product details page.  
- A shopping cart (still under development).  

## Disclaimer  

This project is not intended for real-world use. It was built for personal learning and experimentation.  

## Future Improvements  

- Add user authentication.  
- Enhance the UI design.  
- Implement a backend for storing and retrieving product data.  
- Finalize the shopping cart and checkout process.  

Feel free to explore the code and provide any feedback!
